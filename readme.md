# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### About The Project
This project is an implementation of the research paper [Stock Market Analysis using Supervised
Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862225).   
Here we have implemented almost 100% of the paper and also some sections beyond the scope of the paper.     
The papers basic idea is to take data of a particular stock for the past few years and create a model to predict    
the future stock prices.

### Requirements for Implementing the project
- First you need to have python installed on your local machine.
- After installing python you need to install some specific python libraries
#### Installation
```angular2html
       $ Matplotlib:             pip install matplotlib
       $ Sklearn:                pip install sklearn
       $ Seaborn:                pip install seaborn
       $ Numpy:                  pip install numpy
       $ Datetime                pip install datetime
       $ Jupyter Notebook:       pip install jupyter notebook

or you can simply install all the requirements by running this command in your cloned project directory:
       $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
for more details on these libraries visit their documentation at  
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- [Sklearn](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.20/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
---
- Now that these libraries are installed we can launch the jupyter notebook by using the following command in the command prompt:`jupyter notebook`
- Now we need to install the dataset containing stocks prices for past few years. Here in the paper they have used quandl dataset   
  for the stocks named "WIKI/GOOGL", so we are also using the same dataset. Downloading dataset steps can be found right at the   
  beginning of the ipynb file.
- Now you can:  
    - [Fork](https://github.com/hussein-hub/Stock-Price-Prediction) this Repository
    - Clone your Fork on a different branch:
      - `git clone -b <name-of-branch> https://github.com/hussein-hub/Stock-Price-Prediction`
    - And run the code for yourself
